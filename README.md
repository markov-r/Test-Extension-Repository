# Extension-Repository
Extension Repository is a web application for browsing and downloading of extensions for popular software development tools.
There is a public part listing all extensions, together with tabs "Featured", "New" and "Popular":
Featured extensions are selected by site administration.
New extensions are the extensions that have been updated most recently.
Popular extensions are those that have been downloaded the most.

There is a registration form for new users and of course a login form too.
When logged in the user can add a new extension, or the list of extensions can be browsed and they can be downloaded too.
The admins can disable users and approve or delete extensions.
