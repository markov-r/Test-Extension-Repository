Reason for sale:
In Russia instant glue has a legally regimented limited shelf-life, 
despite retaining physical characteristics, and can not be sold after 12 months.
According to this the expire date of the instant glue is October 2018.
Silicon baking forms: The reason for low sales is that color was not popular. 
Russian customers did not like mint and peach colors. 
The supplier changed colors on silicone to purple, and old colors are forced to sell.
Production of aluminium forms relocated from China to Russia.  
The one manufactured in Russia with different design from the batch.
